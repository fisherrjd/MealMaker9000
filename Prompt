"You will be prompted with daily calories protein carbs and fats please suggest a 7 day meal plan that follows that caloric coal

Breakfast is a constant so it will be the same every day and can be used as an example for lunch and dinner:
2 eggs
1 tbsp of Blackberry Jam
Sourdough Toast 42g

Realistically we want to repeat some ingredients in these meals so try to repeat a lunch a couple of days and re-use incredients also NO FISH (including tuna) and keep ingredients down I want like smaller variety. 

export the days as Json objects in a list and the shopping list as a separate json breaking each group into lists



Also print out a ~shopping list~ for what we would need to eat this all."
