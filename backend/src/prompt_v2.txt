Generate 7 days of meal ideas and a corresponding shopping list, emphasizing the use of specific ingredients from the allowed list.

Your primary goal is twofold:
1.  **Strict Structural Consistency:** The JSON output formats for both the meal ideas list and shopping list MUST be *identical* every time, adhering rigidly to the structures defined below.
2.  **Content Variability:** The specific meal ideas generated SHOULD be *different and varied* each time this prompt is run, while always strictly adhering to the ingredient constraints.

**Objective:** Generate creative meal ideas using the allowed ingredients. **DO NOT calculate calories or macronutrients.** The focus is solely on the meal concepts and the resulting shopping list based on *representative* ingredient usage in those ideas.

**Allowed Ingredients:** Create diverse meal ideas composed primarily from: chicken breast, lean beef, eggs, shredded cheese, and grilled or steamed vegetables (specifically: broccoli, spinach, bell peppers, carrots, onions). Assume olive oil and basic seasonings (salt, pepper) are usable and do not need to be listed. Use grams as a general guide for meat portions in descriptions where helpful (e.g., "~150g Chicken Breast").

**Excluded Ingredients:** Strictly exclude ALL fish and seafood (e.g., Tuna, Salmon, shrimp, etc.). Also exclude quinoa.

**MANDATORY BREAKFAST:** The breakfast MUST always be listed as: "2 Fried Eggs, 1 Slice Ancient Grain Toast, Blackberry Jam". Do not vary this specific meal.

**Foods not to be included with Lunch:** none
**Foods not to be included with Dinner:** none

**Meal Structure:** Exactly 3 meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner) and 1 Snack per day for 7 days (Monday to Sunday).

**Meal Idea Design Strategy:** Prioritize ingredient reuse within the generated week for shopping efficiency (e.g., use chicken suggested for Monday also on Wednesday). However, aim for a *different combination* of meal ideas overall compared to previous runs of this prompt. Generate novel meal ideas within the allowed ingredients.

**OUTPUT 1: Generate the Meal Ideas List as a JSON object.**
JSON Structure MUST be EXACTLY as follows: Top-level object with keys 'Monday' through 'Sunday'.
Each day's value MUST be an object with EXACTLY these keys: 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Snack'.
Values for meals/snacks MUST be descriptive strings suggesting meal ideas using allowed ingredients (e.g., 'Chicken and Bell Pepper Stir-fry', 'Beef Strips with Steamed Broccoli and Carrots', 'Scrambled Eggs (3) with Spinach and Shredded Cheese', 'Sliced Carrots and Bell Peppers'). The Mandatory Breakfast string must be used exactly as specified above for every day. **Do not include any calorie or macro fields.**

**Meal Ideas List Example Snippet (Follow this structure precisely, content will vary):**
'''
{{
  "Monday": {{
    "Breakfast": "2 Fried Eggs, 1 Slice Ancient Grain Toast, Blackberry Jam",
    "Lunch": "Grilled Chicken Salad with Mixed Greens (Spinach), Carrots, Onions, and Shredded Cheese",
    "Dinner": "Beef and Broccoli Stir-fry with Sliced Onions",
    "Snack": "Hard-boiled Eggs (2)"
  }},
  "Tuesday": {{ // Identical structure, different content
    "Breakfast": "2 Fried Eggs, 1 Slice Ancient Grain Toast, Blackberry Jam",
    "Lunch": "Leftover Beef and Broccoli Stir-fry",
    "Dinner": "Chicken Breast (~150g) with Steamed Carrots and Bell Peppers",
    "Snack": "Shredded Cheese (small portion)"
  }}
  // ... etc. for all 7 days
}}
'''

**OUTPUT 2: Generate the Shopping List as a *separate* JSON object based *only* on the meal ideas generated *in Output 1 of this run*.**
JSON Structure MUST be EXACTLY as follows: Top-level object with a single key 'Weekly_Shopping_List'.
The value MUST be an object with EXACTLY these category keys (only include a key if items exist for that category in the generated plan): 'Produce', 'Meat_Protein', 'Dairy_Eggs', 'Pantry'. DO NOT INCLUDE empty categories. Basic pantry staples like Olive Oil, Salt, Pepper should NOT be listed.
Under each category key, the value MUST be a JSON array of strings.
Each string MUST list the ingredient and an estimated quantity needed for the week, derived *conceptually* from the meal ideas generated above. Use the following quantity guidelines for estimation:
    *   **Counts:** For items typically bought individually, estimate the count based on how many meals feature them (using reasonable average weights like ~150-200g/bell pepper, ~300-400g/broccoli head, ~100-150g/onion, ~70g/carrot) and round *up* to the nearest whole number. List these items by count (e.g., 'Bell Peppers: 4', 'Broccoli: 3 heads', 'Onions: 5', 'Carrots: 10').
    *   **Weight (grams):** For meat and poultry, estimate the total grams needed based on typical portion sizes suggested in the meal ideas (e.g., if chicken appears in 5 main meals, estimate ~150-200g per meal = 750-1000g total). List as (e.g., 'Chicken Breast: approx. 1000g', 'Lean Beef: approx. 600g'). Use "approx." to signify estimation.
    *   **Weight (grams) or Bags:** For spinach, estimate total grams or bags needed based on usage (e.g., 'Spinach: approx. 400g' or 'Spinach: 2 bags').
    *   **Counts/Dozen:** For eggs, calculate the total based *only* on Lunch, Dinner, and Snack usage (since breakfast is fixed at 2/day = 14 eggs) and add 14 for breakfast. List the total number (e.g., 'Eggs: 20' (14 for breakfast + 6 for other meals)).
    *   **Pantry:** Include 'Ancient Grain Toast: 1 loaf' and 'Blackberry Jam: 1 jar' as these are explicitly required for the fixed breakfast.
    *   **Weight (grams) or Block/Bag:** For shredded cheese, estimate based on usage (e.g., 'Shredded Cheese: approx. 200g' or 'Shredded Cheese: 1 bag').

Quantities will vary based on the specific meal ideas generated in Output 1. **Ensure the quantities listed are reasonable estimates based on the ingredients featured in the Meal Plan Ideas (Output 1), converting to estimated counts/weights where specified.**

**Shopping List Example (Follow this structure precisely, content/quantities will vary based on the generated ideas above):**

Double check the shopping list estimates align reasonably with the meal ideas generated.

Ensure BOTH JSON outputs are provided, are valid, and strictly follow the specified structures. Prioritize generating a *new and different* set of meal ideas adhering to all constraints each time. Do not add commentary outside the JSON outputs.
